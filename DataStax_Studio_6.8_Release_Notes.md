    # The connection status is tested at the given interval to ensure it is still working.
    # Default: 30000 (30 seconds)
    gremlinHeartbeatIntervalMillis: 30000

    # Graph (gremlin driver) connection timeout interval (milliseconds).
    # The time interval after which the connection will be terminated if there have been
    # no successful user or connection hearbeat queries executed.
    # Default: 90000 (90 seconds)
    gremlinIdleTimeoutMillis: 90000

    # Spark SQL (jdbc driver) connection heartbeat polling interval (milliseconds).
    # The connection status is tested at the given interval to ensure it is still working.
    # Default: 30000 (30 seconds)
    sparkHeartbeatIntervalMillis: 30000

    # Spark SQL (jdbc driver) connection timeout interval (milliseconds).
    # The time interval after which the connection will be terminated if there have been
    # no successful user or connection hearbeat queries executed.
    # Default: 300000 (5 minutes)

```
* Improve ability to troubleshoot Graph errors by logging the remote server stack trace when the Graph gremlin driver reports a ResponseException. (STUDIO-3201)
* Fix issue creating a Classic graph using the Create Graph dialog when connected to DSE versions 6.7 or earlier. (STUDIO-3200)
