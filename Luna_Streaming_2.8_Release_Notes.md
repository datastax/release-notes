# Release notes for Luna Streaming Distribution 2.8.0
30 June 2021

## Component versions for Luna Streaming Distribution 2.8.0

   * Apache Pulsar 2.8.0
   * DataStax Pulsar Admin Console 1.0.0
   * DataStax Pulsar Heartbeat 1.0.2
   * DataStax Apache Pulsar Cassandra Sink 1.4.0
   * DataStax Apache Pulsar Cassandra Source 0.1.0
   * DataStax Burnell 1.0.0
   * Apache BookKeeper 14.1.1
 
This release adds these features to the original Apache Pulsar 2.8.0 release:
  
   * Stability improvements
   * Rootless Docker image
   * Third party libraries updates for security fixes
   * Docker images based on Ubuntu (instead of Debian based images in Pulsar 2.8.0, for security reasons)
   * Dependency upgrades (for security, stability and performances)
   * An Enhanced ElasticSearch Pulsar IO Sink  
   * An Enhanced version of Apache BookKeeper 4.14.1 with security fixes
 
*Note:* The DataStax Luna Streaming Distribution is designed for Java 11. However, because the product releases Docker images, you do not need to install Java (8 or 11) in advance. Java 11 is bundled in the Docker image.

## Upgrade Considerations for Luna Streaming Distribution 2.8.0

As with Luna Streaming 2.7, this release uses non-root containers for enhanced security. When upgrading from a previous version (for example, 2.6.2_1.0.1) files created while running that version will have root permissions and will not be readable by containers running the new version.

To fix this, you can manually log into the ZooKeeper, BookKeeper, and Function Worker containers and make sure that all files in the `/pulsar/data/` and `pulsar/logs` directories are owned by UID 10000 (user pulsar). The group ID of the files should also be set to GID 10001 (group pulsar). Here is an example command:

```
chown -R 10000:10001 /pulsar/data
```

If you are are using the Luna Streaming Helm chart, you can enable automatic repair of the permissions using the `fixRootlessPermissions` setting. For more details on this setting, go [here](https://github.com/datastax/pulsar-helm-chart).

## Upgrade Considerations for custom Pulsar Functions and Pulsar IO Connectors

If you are upgrading from Apache Pulsar 2.7.0 or Luna Streaming 2.7.2 you may need to recompile your Pulsar Functions or Pulsar IO Connectors using Apache Pulsar 2.8.0 as a dependency in certain cases.
This is because there is a breaking API change in Apache Pulsar 2.8.0 (and so in Luna Streaming 2.8.0) related to the SchemaInfo java class.
More context [here](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/11338).
