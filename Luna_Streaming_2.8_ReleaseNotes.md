## Upgrade Considerations for Luna Streaming Distribution 2.8.0

As with Luna Streaming 2.7, this release uses non-root containers for enhanced security. When upgrading from a previous version (for example, 2.6.2_1.0.1) files created while running that version will have root permissions and will not be readable by containers running the new version.

To fix this, you can manually log into the ZooKeeper, BookKeeper, and Function Worker containers and make sure that all files in the `/pulsar/data/` and `pulsar/logs` directories are owned by UID 10000 (user pulsar). The group ID of the files should also be set to GID 10001 (group pulsar). Here is an example command:

```
chown -R 10000:10001 /pulsar/data
```

If you are are using the Luna Streaming Helm chart, you can enable automatic repair of the permissions using the `fixRootlessPermissions` setting. For more details on this setting, go [here](https://github.com/datastax/pulsar-helm-chart).
